title=Hush Little Baby

Hush little baby
Don't you cry
Papa's gonna sing you a lullaby
Hush little baby
Don't say a word
Papa's gonna bring you baby a mocking bird
And if that mocking bird won't sing well
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring
If that ring don't shine
It would break this heart of mine
