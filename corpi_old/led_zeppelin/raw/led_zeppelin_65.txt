title=Ten Years Gone

Then as it was, then again it will be
Though the course may change some times
River's always reached the sea
Flyin' the skies of Fortune
Each our separate ways
On the wings of maybe
Downing birds of prey
Kind of makes me feel sometimes
Didn't have to grow
But as the eagle leaves the nest
Got so far to go
Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be
See your eyes now sparkle, Senses growing keen
Tasted love along the way, See your feathers preen
Kind of makes makes me feel sometimes, Didn't have to grow
We are eagles of one nest, The nest is in our soul
Vixen in my dreams, a great surprise to me
Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be
Oh darlin', oh darlin'
I'm never gonna leave you. I never gonna leave
Holdin' on, ten years gone
Ten years gone, holdin' on, ten years gone
Did you ever really need somebody, And really need 'em bad
Did you ever really want somebody, The best love you ever had
Do you ever remember me, baby, did it feel so good
'Cause it was good the first time, And you knew you would
