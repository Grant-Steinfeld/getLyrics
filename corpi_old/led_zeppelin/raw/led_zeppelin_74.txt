title=Think It Over

Think it over in your pretty little head
Think it over what you just said
Are you sure I'm not the one?
( ? )
Well think it over
Yes think it over
Oh my heart grows cold and old
Think it over and let me know
Think it over darlin? don't be slow
Are you sure I'm not the one?
( ? ) now let me know
Well think it over
Ahh think it over
Oh my heart grows cold and older
Hey! think it over, over and over
Think it over, over and over
