title=Livin' Lovin' Maid (She's Just A Woman)

With a purple umbrella and a fifty-cent hat
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Mrs. Cool rides out in her aged Cadillac
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Come on, babe, on the roundabout, ride on the merry-go-'round
We all know what your name is, so you better lay your money down
Alimony, alimony, payin' your bills
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
When your conscience hits, ya knock it back with pills
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Come on, baby, on the roundabout, ride on the merry-go-'round
We all know what your name is, so you better lay your money down
Tellin' tall tales of how it used to be
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
with the butler and the maid and the servants three
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman/Aw, get it, now, get it
Aw, you got it, man, yeah, ah
Nobody hears a single word you say
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
but you'll keep on talkin' 'till your dyin' day
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Come on, baby, on the roundabout, ride on the merry-go-'round
We all know what your name is, so you better lay your money down
A-livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Livin', livin', lovin', lovin'
Livin', lovin', she's just a woman
Live-li-li-li-li-li-li, love-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
