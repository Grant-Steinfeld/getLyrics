Hey hey mama said the way you move,
Gonna make you sweat gonna make you groove.
Oh oh child way you shake that thing,
Gonna make you burn gonna make you sting.
Hey hey baby when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip can't keep away.
I gotta roll can't stand still,
Got a flaming heart can't get my fill.
Eyes that shine burning red,
Dreams of you all through my head.
Hey baby,
Oh baby,
Pretty baby.
Hey baby,
Oh baby,
Pretty baby.
Didn't take too long before I found out,
What people mean by down and out.
Spent my money took my car,
Started tellin' her friends she gonna be a star.
I don't know but I been told,
A big legged woman ain't got no soul.
All I ask for when I pray,
Steady rollin' woman gonna come my way.
Need a woman gonna hold my hand,
And tell me no lies make me a happy man.
