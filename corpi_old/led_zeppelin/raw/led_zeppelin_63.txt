title=Tangerine

Measuring in a summer's day,
I can only find it slips away to grey,
The hours, they bring me pain.
*Tangerine, Tangerine,
Living REFLECTIONS from a dream;
I was her love, she was my queen,
And now a thousand years between.
Thinking how it used to be,
Does she still remember times like these?
To think of us again?
And I do.
* Chorus
