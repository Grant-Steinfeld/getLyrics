title=Ramble On

Leaves are falling all around,
It's time I was on my way.
Thanks to you I'm much obliged,
For such a pleasant stay.
But now it's time for me to go,
The autumn moon lights my way.
For now I smell the rain,
And with it pain,
And it's headed my way.
Sometimes I grow so tired,
But I know I've got one thing I got to do,
Ramble on,
And now's the time the time is now.
To sing my song,
I'm going around the world,
I got to find my girl.
On my way,
I've been this way ten years to the day.
Ramble on,
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams.
Got no time to for spreading roots,
The time has come to be gone.
And though our health we drank a thousand times,
It's time to ramble on.
Ramble on,
And now's the time the time is now.
To sing my song,
I'm going around the world,
I got to find my girl.
On my way,
I've been this way ten years to the day.
Ramble on,
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams.
I ain't telling no lie.
Mine's a tale that can't be told,
My freedom I hold dear.
How years ago in days of old,
When magic filled the air.
It was in the darkest depths of Mordor,
I met a girl so fair.
But Gollum and the evil one crept up,
And slipped away with her.
Ain't nothing I can do no,
I guess I'll keep on rambling.
I'm gonna shake.
Gonna ramble on, sing my song.
Gonna work my way around the world.
I can't stop this feeling in my heart,
Gotta keep searching for my baby
