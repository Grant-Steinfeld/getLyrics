title=Blue Gangsta

What you gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
What you gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta
[MICHAEL:]
What you gonna do
'Cause I'm gonna get you
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
All the things you said
And the things you've done to me
You can no longer make me cry
Look what you done to me baby
I can no longer smile baby
And I've waited so long
Just to carry on
I'm the blue gangsta
What you gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
What you gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(I can never fall in love)
The blue gangsta
What you gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(What you gonna do)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
(Aah-Ahhh)
What you gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(I can never fall in love)
The blue gangsta
[MICHAEL:]
You've tricked me nine to five
Loving you is a crime
People telling me
You got another guy
I've been abused
Watch me like the fuse
Said you'd be my wife
Nothing but big lies
Don't know what I've done
Everything you got
Things you done to me
Coming back to you
You know just what I've done
The things you've done to me
I'm the blue gangsta
What you gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine (oh no)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
(I'm the blue gangsta)
What you gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(I can never fall in love)
The blue gangsta
What you gonna do
(What you gonna do)
You ain't no friend of mine
(what you gonna do)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
(Look what you put me through girl)
What you gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine (oh no)
(I can never fall in love)
The blue gangsta
[MICHAEL:]
See, I'm so amused
To the things you said
And the things you done, done to me
There is nothing in this world
That would make me change
Nah-ah, Nah-ah
The blue gangsta
What you gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(What you gonna do)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
(Look what you put me through baby)
What you gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(I'm never gonna fall in love)
The blue gangsta
What you gonna do
(What you gonna do)
You ain't no friend of mine
(What you gonna do)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
(Look what you put me through girl)
What you gonna do (oh no)
You ain't no friend of mine
(I'm never gonna fall in love)
The blue gangsta
What you gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(You ain't no friend of mine)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta
(You ain't no friend of mine)
What you gonna do (oh no)
You ain't no friend of mine
(I'm never gonna fall in love)
The blue gangsta
What you gonna do
(What you gonna do)
You ain't no friend of mine
(See what you did put me through)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (Nah-ah)
What you gonna do (oh no)
You ain't no friend of mine
(Ohh no no)
The blue gangsta
