title=Planet Earth

Girl, close your eyes,
let that Rhythm get into you.
Don't try to fight it,
there ain't nothing that you can do.
Relax your mind.
Lay back and groove with mine.
You've gotta feel that beat,
and we can ride the boogie.
Share that beat alone
Chorus
I wanna rock with you all night
Dance you into sun light
I wanna rock with you all night
Were gonna rock the night away
Out on the floor,
there aint nobody there but us.
Girl when you dance,
there's a magic that must be love.
Just take it slow,
cause we got so far to go
You've gotta feel that beat,
and we can ride the boogie.
Share that beat alone
Chorus
And when the groove is dead and gone.
You know that love survives,
so we can rock forever.
