Sunset Driver (demo)
(written & composed by Michael Jackson)
all alone
she's in the ego zone
the word is out that you're doing wrong
on the move
got fire in your shoes
by word of mouth
you are on the news
your living in sunset times {livin in sunset times}
hoo!
feelin bad
you're livin much too fast
the truth, the truth
that cha on the pass
in the raw
they don't know what you saw
from word of mouth
you're breaking every law
sunset driver
midnight rider
friday's brighter
morning rider
youre a saturday nighter, AAAAAAOW!
on the go
got fever in your soul
you ___ hot shot
where ya gonna go?
living hot
doin what you should not
the bigs are me
but what do you got
we're living in sunset times {living in sunset times}
want that dimeeee.....
shoot the breeze
you feel that she's a tease
your night is be what ya wanna be
who's to trust?
we're living dangerous
your lights are black
but this is what ja moose'8o
sunset driver
midnight rider
friday's brighter
the breath in Higher
you're a saturday nighter, AOWWWWWW!
HOO!

duukuh dun nuh nuh nuh nuh nuhn na nuhn
