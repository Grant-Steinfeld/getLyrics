title=Don't Let It Get You Down

Don't let it get you down - when you're not on top
When I stumble through - what gets up and never stops
No, ain't it a doggone shame - lovin' ain't a friendly game
Don't let it get you down - ah no
Don't let it get you down - when the cards are wrong
Pick up - let them walk away - before you lose your heart
(Ah no, don't look back girl)
Ain't it a doggone shame - lovin' ain't a friendly game
(Don't let it) don't let it get you down -
(ah no, don't let it) ah no
Look at me -
don't it seem like I know what I'm talkin' about
Don't you see -
let me be the one that can straighten it out, girl
Yeah, (don't let it get you down) - (ah no) don't let it
(Don't let it get you down - ah no) don't let it
Ain't it a doggone shame - lovin' ain't a friendly game
Don't let it get you down - (ah no) don't let it
I can bring you sunshine - make you happy
(I can bring you sunshine)
Ain't no cloudy skies - and you know me, yeah
(Don't let it get you down)
Don't let it get you down - you can start again
Now yesterday is gone - let tomorrow be your friend
(Don't look back girl) Hey, don't let back girl
Mama is straight ahead - (don't let it)
don't let it get you down (Oh no, don't let it)
Look at me -
don't it seem like I know what I'm talkin' about
Don't you see -
let me be the one that can straighten it out, girl
I can straighten it out girl, yeah
Don't let it get you down, (ah no, don't let it) no
Don't let it get you down, (don't let it)
Come on baby
Don't let it get you down, (ah no, don't let it)
Come on sugar - yeah
Don't let it get you down (ah no, don't let it) - whew
Don't let it get you down
