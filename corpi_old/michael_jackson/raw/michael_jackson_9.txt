title=Al Capone

Why did you let him get away
After the staring what did you say
You shot me down as cold as ice
Staring my face ill hold you tight
Why did you let him get away
After the staring what did you say
You shot me down as cold as ice
Staring my face ill hold you tight
Too Bad
Forget it cus
its Al Capone thats in
it
Too Sad
Regret it cus
a mad man is out tonight
Should have told nobody ever showed her but us
The Girl was griefing nobody should be griefing this way.
Why did you let him get away
After the staring what did you say
You shot me down as cold as ice
Staring my face ill hold you tight
Why did you let him get away
After the staring what did you say
You shot me down as cold as ice
Staring my face ill hold you tight
Too Bad
Forget it cus
its Al Capone thats in it
Too Sad
Regret It cus
I told her out tonight
Should have told her nobody ever showed her but us
The girl was griefing nobody should be griefing this way
oow!!!
(Chorus and first verse continuis)
