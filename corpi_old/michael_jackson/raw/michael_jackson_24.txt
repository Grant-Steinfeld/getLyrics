title=Blood On The Dance Floor

She got your number
She know your game
Look what took you under
It's so insane
Since you seduced her
How does it feel
To know that woman
Is out to kill
Overnight stand is like takin a chance
Its not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Every hot man is out takin their chances
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it
To escape the world I got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it
Refrain:
Susie's got your number
And Susie's got your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
BLOOD IS ON THE DANCEFLOOR
Blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number
And Susie says it right.
She got your number
How does it feel
To know this stranger
Is out to kill
She got your baby
It happened fast
If you could only
Erase the past
