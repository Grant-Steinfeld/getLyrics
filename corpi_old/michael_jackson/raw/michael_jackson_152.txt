title=Scared Of The Moon

Alone she lays waiting
surrounded by gloom
Invaded by shadows
painting the room
The light from the window
cuts through the air
and pins the child lying there
Scared of the moon
She pulls up the covers
and shivers in fright
She hides from the color
that rides on the night
The light through the window
that lights up the sky
and causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon
There's nothing wrong
don't be bothered they said
it's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
it's really too soon
but there she lies shivering
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
The years go by swiftly
And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
when evening descends
The fear of the child
still intrude the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon
The feeling of terror
she felt as a youth
has returned from a fantasy
into a truth
The moon is the enemy
twisting her soul
and taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon
But now there are others
who sit in their room
and wait for the sunlight
to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
their lunacy shared
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
But now there are others
who sit in their room
and wait for the sunlight
to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
their lunacy shared
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
