title=Be My Lover

A Very rare song
You are the one i have been looking for
the truth that i have been longing for
All time u and i
on the shores
of the ocean
Looking at the tides of our love
How can i deny
who am i to lie
This feeling and burning desire
Chorus:
I will be here for u
And our love
is true
And we can go far to places if only u
Be My Love
Be My Love
This is a feeling
i havent gotten for a while
You are perfectly sent from above
for me
The truth lies in you
eyes
I cant just let this
moment be
Girl u ard my ectasy
my fantasy
my world to be
how can i deny
who am i to lie
(Chorus X2)
Be my
Be my
Oh Be My
my
my
my
love
oh my love
my love
Chorus continues
