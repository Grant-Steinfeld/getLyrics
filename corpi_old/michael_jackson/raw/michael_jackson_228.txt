title=You're The Best My Friend, My Love

When I need more than love
You are the one that I run too
When just words aren't enough
You know exactly what to do
And everytime I need someone
To turn my upside down back up
You're always there
I am so glad you care
(chorus)
You're my best friend, my love
My love, you're my best friend, my love
My love, you are my best friend
Hmmm Ooh
You're my warm, when it's cold
You are my sunshine when it rains
And if the rain turns to snow
We'd still be on that friendship train
Cuz if our love affair should end
I know I'll never find a friend
As great as you
Girl I'm glad it's true
(Repeat Chorus)
(Sang with chorus)
Oh Girl they'll be no other
You're my friend and lover
Don't you know I love ya
You're my friend and lover
Ooh Ooh
Girl, there will always be someone to love ya
Someone who can love ya
Yes you are, yes
You're my friend and lover
Oh girl, they'll be no other
Ooh Ooh Ooh
And I'll be yours forever
You and me together
[fade out]
