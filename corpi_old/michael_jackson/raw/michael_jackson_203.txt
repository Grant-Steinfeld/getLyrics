title=What Goes Around Comes Around

I've had my eyes on you 3 long years.
when no one else wanted you I took you in
and held your near
but then you drifted away
after you said you'd always stay
how could you be so mean and untrue
he didn't want you until he seen
what my love did for you
yeah
Chorus:
oh baby
What goes around comes around
i knew he'd soon be gone
yeah baby
he put you down now you're the clown
and you want me to come back home
yeah yeah yeah
i've had no love affairs 3 long years
remember how i use to care when you
were down, i dried your tears
who did you think was the fool
i let you treat me so cruel
this is the moment of truth for you
do you think your playin' is through
i don't think i can trust you.
Chorus:
oh baby
What goes around comes around
i knew he'd soon be gone
yeah baby
he put you down now you're the clown
and you want me to come back home
yeah yeah yeah
Chorus:
What goes around comes around
he put you down now you're the clown
what goes around yeah
comes around yeah
Refrain:
I've had my eyes on you 3 long years
when no one else wanted you I took you in
and held your near
yeah
Chorus:
yeah yeah baby
What goes around comes around
i knew he'd soon be gone
no no baby
he put you down now your the clown
and you want me to come back home
yeah yeah yeah
Chorus:
What goes around comes around
he put you down now you're the clown
yeah
don't you know

don't you know
yeah yeah baby
