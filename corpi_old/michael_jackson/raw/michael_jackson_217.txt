title=Worlds Together

(Start)
The first day I saw your face,
my heart begin to race,
my feelins being to rise,
as i look into those eyes,
what is this i'm feeling,
as you look so appealing,
Chorus:
We are worlds together
all for the better
i feel your love
like doves in a world together
You are my girl
with teeth like pearls
so why don't you come with me
and feel world's peace
(chorus)
so take my hand
in to peace and new lands
in a world of love
like two flying doves
so let it be you and me
for forever and ever and pass eternaty
(chorus)
so take my hand
in to peace and new lands
in a world of love
like two flying doves
so let it be you and me
for forever and ever and pass eternity
(end)
