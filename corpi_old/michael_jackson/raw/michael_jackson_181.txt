title=The Man

(with paul mccartney)
There's a man
Who plays the game of life so well
Ooh, there's such a man
His thoughts you can never tell, ooh
And it's just the way he
Thought it would be
'cause the day has come
For him to be free
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man
And it's just the way she
Thought it would be
As he says, something has
Happened to me
Then he laughs, he kicks
And rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man
There's a man
Everybody thought they knew
Ooh, there's such a man
He's not like me and you, ooh
And it's just the way she
Thought it would be
As he says, something has
Happened to me
Then he laughs, he kicks
And rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man
And it's just the way she
Thought it would be
As he says, something has
Happened to me
Then he laughs, he kicks
And rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man
And it's just the way she
Thought it would be
As he says, something has
Happened to me
Then he laughs, he kicks
And rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man
(this is the man)
Ooh yeah
(ooh, yeah)
This is the man
(this is the man)
This is the man
