title=Say Say Say

(with paul mccartney)
(paul)
Say say say
What you want
But don't play games
With my affection
Take take take
What you need
But don't leave me
With no direction
(michael)
All alone
I sit home by the phone
Waiting for you, baby
Through the years
How can you stand to hear
My pleading for ya dear
You know I'm cryin
Oo oo oo oo oo
(paul)
(now) go go go
Where you want
But don't leave me
Here forever
You you you stay away
So long girl, I see ya never
(michael)
What can I do, girl
To get through to you
Cause I love ya baby
Standing here
Baptized in all my tears
Baby through the years
Ya know I'm cryin
Oo oo oo oo oo
You never ever worry
And ya never shed a tear
You're sayin that my love ain't real
Just look at my fac these tears ain't dryin?
You you you
Can never say
That I'm not the one
Who really loves you
I pray pray pray, everyday
That you'll see things
Girl like I do
What can I do, girl
To get through to you
Cause I love you baby
Standing here
Baptized in all my tears
Baby through the years
Ya know I'm crying
Oo oo oo oo oo
Say say say...
(repeat and fade out)
