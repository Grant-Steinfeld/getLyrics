title=Right Here (Feat. Swv)

SWV:
Loves gonna be--

DJ:
S,The Double, The U, The V
SWV:
Lately there seems to be
Some insecurities
About the way I feel
where I wanna be.
boy you know its with you.
Noone can do the things you do to me.
Michael:
Get me out
Into the nightime
four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
then let me take a bite
chorus
(love will be right here)
If they say why why
(be Right here)
tell them that its human nature
(right here)
Why Why does he do me that way
(be right here)
If they say Why why
(no fear)
tell em that its human nature
(Have no fear)
Why Why does he do me that way?
(no tears)
why why why
(love is here)
SWV:
true love some don't believe in
thats just what im givin
I'm gonna keep it stong
I'll be holdin' on to you.
Noone can do me like you do.
Its true.
Michael:
Reaching out
Touch a stranger
Eletric eyes of everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
[Chorus]
SWV:
Won't let go
You should know
this thing is real
Don't rush now
Just listen to your heart
And love will be right here
Be right here
Right here
Loves gonna be right here, yea
Loves gonna be--
Loves gonna be--
[chorus to fade]
