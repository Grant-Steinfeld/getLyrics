title=I Am A Loser

You laughed at me
you made me cry
You made a joke
then wonder why
(I am a loser)
(I am a loser)
I say "hello"
you say "goodbye"
I reach to you
you don't even try
(I am a loser)
(I am a loser)
If losing you makes me happy
then why does it make me cry
If losing you makes you a winner
then how did our love ever die 
I'm born to lose
you know it's true
and here I stand
I'm losing you
(I am a loser)
(I am a loser)
You are the one
to let me know
You needed me
now I have to go
(I am a loser), alright
(I am a loser)
If losing you makes you happy
then why does it make me cry
If losing you makes me a winner
then how did our love ever die, ever die
I am a fool
you know it's true
I believed in you
now you don't even try
(I am a loser), alright
(I am a loser)
What foolish kind
of guy am I
You break my heart
I wonder why
(I am a loser), alright
