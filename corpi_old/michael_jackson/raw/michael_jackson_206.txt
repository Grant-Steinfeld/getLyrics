title=Whatzupwitu

(with eddie murphy)
Sun is gonna shine
Flowers gonna grow
Clouds'll sprinkle showers
Rivers gonna flow
Man ain't got the power
To kill nothing but himself
Man is a creation
Man is nothing else
Whatzup, whatzup, whatzupwitu
Whatzup, whatzup, whatzupwitu
Always is the mountain
Always is the tree's
Always is the ocean
Always is the sea's
We can't stop this world
'cause it's not
Our world we can just jack
Each other up
Heavenly been mighty patient
He got your number peeped
Your disease
He knows your falling,
Your falling, your falling,
Man is a creation
Man is nothing else
Whatzup, whatzup, whatzupwitu
Whatzup, whatzup, whatzupwitu
(repeat and fade out)
