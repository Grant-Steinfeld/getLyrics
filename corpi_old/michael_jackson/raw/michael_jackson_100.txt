title=In Our Small Way

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating in your heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere
I'm gonna be
Exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's scorning me
Cos you're warning me
To be the stranger in the night
Am I amusing you
Or just confusing you
Am I the beast you visualize
And if you wanna see
Eccentricities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize
Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you boy
Is it scary for you babe
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you baby
Yeah
There's a creaking in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin nearly open
Where a restless soul is floating
I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And sprits dancing in the night
But if you came to see
The truth of purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start
Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you boy
Am I scary for you babe
Am I scary for you boy
So tell me is this scary for you baby
Tell me
Hoo!
So tell me is that crazy for you baby
Am I scary for you
You know that stranger is you
Am I scary for ya
Masquerade the heart
Is the heart of burning souls
Just not what you see girl in me
Cos the heart reveals the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See the evil one is you
Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh boy
Am I scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh
So tell me am I scary for you baby
Hoo!
Am I scary for you baby
Is it scary for you baby
Am I scary for you boy
Wanna talk about it
Tell me
Don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it
What's scary for you baby
Hoo
Hoo
Is it scary for you
I'm tired of being abused
You know you're scaring me too
I think the evil is you
Is it scary for you baby oh
Oooh babe
