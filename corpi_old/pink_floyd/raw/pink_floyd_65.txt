title=King Bee

Well, I'm a king bee
Buzzing around your hive
Yes, I'm a king bee, child
Buzzing around your hive
I can make good honey
Let me come inside
I'm young and able
To buzz all night long
You know I'm young and able
To buzz all night long
When you hear me buzz, little girl
You know some stinging's going on
(well, buzz some) I'll sting (yeah)
Well, I'm a king bee
Can buzz all night long
Yes I'm a king bee
Can buzz all night long
Well, I buzz better baby,
When your man is gone.
