title=Yet Another Movie

One sound, one single sound
one kiss, one single kiss,
a face outside the window pane,
however did it come to this?
A man who ran: a child who cried
a girl who heard, a voice that lied
the sun that burned a fiery red
the vision of an empty bed
The use of forge, he was so tough
she'll soon submit, she's had enough
the march of fate, the broken will
someone is lying very still
He has laughed and he has cried
he has fought and he has died
he's just the same as all the rest,
he's not the worst, he's not the best
And still this ceaseless murmuring,
the babbling that I brook,
the seas of faces, eyes upraised
the empty screen, the vacant look
A man in black on a snow white horse,
a pointless life has run it's course,
the red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
as he fades into the setting sun
