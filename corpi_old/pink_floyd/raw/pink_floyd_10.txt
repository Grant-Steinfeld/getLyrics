title=Another Brick In The Wall (Compliation)

Daddys Flown Across the Ocean
Leaving Just a Memory
A Snapshot in the Family Album
Daddy what else did you leave for me?
Dad What You Leave Behind for me?
All and all it was just a brick in the wall
all in all it was all just bricks in the wall
* Hey!*
(Children Speaking)
(Helicopters)
*You, Yes You, Stand Still Laddie!*
When we grew up and went to school, there were certain teachers who would hurt the children anyway they could
by pouring any region upon anything they did, exposing every weakness and carefully they did to the kids.
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave us kids alone!
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave us kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
Spoken:
"Wrong, Do it again!
Wrong, Do it again!
If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding.
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?
You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still laddie!"
[Sound of many TV's coming on, all on different channels]
"The Bulls are already out there"
Pink: "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrgh!"
"This Roman Meal bakery thought you'd like to know."
I don't need no arms around me
And I dont need no drugs to calm me.
I have seen the writing on the wall.
Don't think I need anything at all.
No! Don't think I'll need anything at all.
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall.
