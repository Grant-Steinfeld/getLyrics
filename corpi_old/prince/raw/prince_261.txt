Ooh, here I go again
Falling in love all over
Ooh, the cycle never ends
U just pray u don't get burned
Ooh, this fire inside of me
Don't nobody realize
Ooh, what u r 2 me
But baby u got 2 learn
I'm making u a coat of pink cashmere
U got 2 know how I feel about u
How I always want u near
I'm making u a coat of pink cashmere
I'm counting every minute of every hour
'Til u r here
Girl, can u understand
I never used 2 go dancing

And thank Him I'm not alone (I am not alone)
