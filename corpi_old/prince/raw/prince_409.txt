title=You Will Be Moved

Performed by Mavis Staples
Composed by Prince
U will be moved when the baby lets out his very first cry
U will be moved when U think of how hard he'll have 2 try
He'll grow up on an empty stomach, but he'll try his best 2 listen
2 the teacher readin' from a schoolbook with half the pages missin'
CHORUS:
Surely when the rain comes, U will be moved
La da da da da
See the video
U will be moved, and U will be when the baby makes all the grades
U will be moved, and U will be when they still don't hire him anyway
Moved by a system without one single guarantee
That an education is the answer and love will set us free
CHORUS
Oh, U will be moved when the rain comes, oh yes, U will be moved
When the streets overflow with angry souls, that's when U see the truth
When the pain that U've inflicted comes back on your door 2 roost (Back on your door 2 roost)
That's when U'll see the future (future), but U won't see U
CHORUS
U will be moved when the whip comes down on the back of one of your own
U will be moved when U look 4 compassion but U find U're all alone
Moved, and U will be when U are, that's when U'll know
That the bread U share is better than the blood that your deeds have caused 2 flow
(That the bread is better than the blood)
CHORUS
Hey, U will be moved when the rain comes, oh yes, U will be moved
When the streets all flow with angry souls, that's when U'll see the truth
When the pain that U've inflicted comes back on your door 2 roost (Back on your door 2 roost)
That's when U'll see the future (future), but U won't see U
I said surely when the rain comes, U will be moved
La da da da da (La da da da da)
See the video
Hey, surely, surely, surely (when the rain comes)
Surely y'all
Ow, la da da da da
