title=4 The Tears In Your Eyes

Long ago, there was a man
Change stone 2 bread with the touch of his hand
Made the blind see and the dumb understand
He died 4 the tears in your eyes
Your eyes
Many people came from all around
Hear this man preach, glorious sound
Spoke of man in harmony and love abound
He died 4 the tears in your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your...eye...
Died 4 the tears in your eyes
4 the tears in your eyes
And the tears of sorrow
4 cents may be all that they're worth
For the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth
The earth
Faith is a word, we all should try
Describing the man who willingly died
Believe that your hunger, sorrow, and fears
Is less than the tears in your eyes
Your eyes
Less than the tears in your eyes
4 the tears in your eyes
And the tears of sorrow
4 cents may be all that they're worth (All they're worth)
For the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth
Say it again...
4 the tears in your eyes
And the tears of sorrow
4 cents may be all that they're worth (All they're worth)
For the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth
The earth
Thank you
