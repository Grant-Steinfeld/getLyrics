title=4 The Tears In Your Eyes (Usa For Africa Version)

Long ago there was a man
Who changed stone 2 bread with one touch of his hand
He made the blind see and the dumb understand
And He died 4 the tears in your eyes (Your eyes)
Many people came from all around
2 hear this man preach with glorious sound
He spoke of man in harmony and love abound
And He died 4 the tears in your eyes (Your eyes)
He died 4 the tears in your eyes (Your eyes)
CHORUS:
4 the tears in your eyes if they're tears of sorrow
4 cents may be all that they're worth
4 the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth, the earth
Faith is a word we all should try
In describing the man who willingly died
Believe that your sorrow, hunger, and fears
Is less than the tears in your eyes, your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes
Less than the tears in your eyes (Your eyes)
CHORUS
(Assures us)
(All they're worth)
CHORUS
