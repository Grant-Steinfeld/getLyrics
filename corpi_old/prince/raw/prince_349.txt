title=The Greatest Romance Ever Sold (Remix)

The Greatest Romance that's ever been sold
So what Do U know - U and Me
Finally, Face 2 Face
Checking each other up and down
in all the obvious places
Was there ever a reason 4 us 2 be apart
the air that fills up this room says
not hardly
so this is where u end and U and EYE begin
(this is where u and eye begin)
THE GREATEST ROMANCE THAT'S EVER BEEN SOLD (2x)
(Baby, Baby)
Now Your Mind is open
2 Poetry Seldom Heard
Your Heart Has Never Been Broken In
Until You've Heard These Words
Your Body Was Designed 2 Respond 2 Mine
In Spite Of Your Desire 2 mold me
And In the Middle of it all
We Kiss Like Rain Fall in2-
THE GREATEST ROMANCE THAT'S EVER BEEN SOLD (2x)
EYE know U Feel Me Eye Know That U can DANCE
but what do U know about the greatest ROMANCE?
Not WHAT U THINK but what U believe
WHAT was the real reason that ADAM NEVER left EVE
AND if the Truth Sounds Like a MEMORY then U
know it was meant 2 be (meant 2 be)
Leave YOUR INHIBITIONS behind
C'mon C'mon and see why -
so this is where u end and U and EYE begin
THE GREATEST ROMANCE THAT'S EVER BEEN SOLD (2x)
EYE know U Feel Me Eye Know That U can DANCE
but what do U know about the greatest ROMANCE?
Not WHAT U THINK but what U believe
WHAT was the real reason that ADAM NEVER left EVE
Listen U brought ME the Grapes From the VINE -
YES U DID
THE GREATEST ROMANCE THAT'S EVER BEN SOLD
