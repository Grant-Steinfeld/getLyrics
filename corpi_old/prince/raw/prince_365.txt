title=The Same December

If ur Last December came what would u do?
Would anybody remember 2 remember u?
Did u stand tall?
Or did u fall?
Did u give ur all?
Did u ever find a reason y u had 2 die?
Or did u just plan on leaving without wondering y?
Was it everything it seemed?
Or did it feel like a dream?
Did u feel redeemed?
In the name of the Father
In the name of the Son
We need 2 come 2together
Come 2gether as one
Did u love somebody but got no love in return?
Did u understand the real meaning of love that it just is and never yearns?
When the truth arrives
Will u b lost on the other side?
Will u still b alive?
In the name of the Father
In the name of the Son
We need 2 come 2together
Come 2gether as one
In ur life did u just give a little
or did u give all that u had?
Were u just somewhere in the middle
Not 2 good, not 2 bad?
In the name of the Father
In the name of the Son
We need 2 come 2together
Come 2gether as one
