title=The One

If U're lookin' 4 the man that will walk away from responsibility
I ain't the one {x3}
And if U're lookin' 4 the brotha that'll treat U like anything but a
queen
I ain't the one
But if U're lookin' 4 a man that'll sweep U off your tired weary feet
Pay your bills, buy U pretty dresses
And take U anywhere U wanna eat
Make love 2 U every night of the week
Oh, don't think it over, girl
Look no further
I am the one
Oh yes I am
If U're lookin' 4 a man that'll make big money
And keep it all 2 himself
I ain't the one
No, no - not me
And if U're lookin' 4 a man that'll have 10 women
And confuse it all with his wealth
Listen here, I ain't that one
No, no no - wait a minute
If U're lookin' 4 a man who can share his dinero (His money)
Buy U half the town (Half the town)
Treat every step U take (Every step)
As if U're walkin', huh, on holy ground (Holy ground)
Place U, place U above all others
When it comes, when it comes 2 the gettin' on down (Down)
Look no further, ooh
Your man's around (He's around)
Oh yes he is
He's standing right here, right here (Right here, right here)
Don't U look no further, girl
He's standing right here, right here
(I am the one) {x2}
If U're lookin' 4 a man that'll make U feel like time has just begun,
ooh
A man that'll make U feel like U're the only thing that ever
mattered
Underneath the sun, underneath the sun, ooh
If U're lookin' 4 somebody
Who will turn your bad day into one long night of fun
Look no further, baby
I'm... I'm the one
Oh yes I am
I am the one
Don't U look no further, girl
Oh, I am the one
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh
My, my, my little Mayte
I'm the one
