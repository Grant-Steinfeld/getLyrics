title=Oh Shelia

OH SHEILA
Like I always say what's good for the goose is
good for the gander.
oh Sheila, oh, in
2-Oh baby love me right
Let me love you till I get it right, hmm
Can't you let the others be
'Cause with you is where I got to be
Oh, sugar where you been
Hangin' out with your male friends
Listen, somebody's going to hurt you
The way you love, to keep hurting me, we say
1-Oh oh Sheila let me love you
Till the morning comes
Oh oh Sheila you know I want
To be the only one
3-Oh baby, understand that I want
To be the only man
But it seems you're screaming too hard
Now think yourself to have an only friend
Oh baby, it's plain to see
That you're qualified to fill my needs
4-I think you threw an oath on me
Honey, baby, just you wait and see
And we say
(repeat 1)
Oh baby, it's 1-2-3
I love you baby honestly, hmm, I want to
Di a di da li a di a di da li
Oh, oh Sheila...
(repeat 2, 3, 4, 1)
