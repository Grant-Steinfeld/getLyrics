title=Shoo-bed-ooh

So U thought U just might lose your mind 2day
Brother pushin' that game on ya as if U wanna play
Askin' U every other sentence if them titties are real
One tramp even had the nerve 2 touch 'em as if U wanted a feel
CHORUS:
Shoo-bed-ooh, shoo-bed-ooh, ooh!
Shoo-bed-ooh, shoo-bed-ooh, ooh!
The money that U make ain't payin' the rent, so U sleep in cars
U wonder aloud if U're happy - U say, "Yea," as if U really are
This car U drive with no gas won't take U very far
U look up in the sky and wish upon a star (Upon a star)
CHORUS
The answer 2 the question of life is a gray-haired bitch at least
Suckin' on the ebony dancer in between these dirty sheets
Spittin' out the aftertaste of a boy who might not call again
If this is the game U stood in line 4  how're U gonna win?
(How're U gonna win?)
Shoo-bed-ooh, shoo-bed-ooh, ooh!
So U thought he just might come every time U phone
As if U've never been lonely as if U've never been alone
(As if U've never been alone)
How U ever gonna win if U let 'em all see your hand?
Playin' the queen don't work on your knees as if U understand
CHORUS {x2}
The answer 2 the question of life is a gray-haired bitch at least
Suckin' on the ebony dancer in between these dirty sheets
Spittin' out the aftertaste of a boy who might not call again
If this is the game U stood in line 4  how're U gonna win?
How U gonna win?
CHORUS {x2}
So U thought U just might lose your mind 2day
