Extraordinary
The love U make 2 me itç£? some kind of scary
I would B a fool 2 leave U 4 I was born 2 love U
This is true
Extraordinary
The way U make me feel
Iç£? so very glad itç£? real
And not a dream
Even though it seems I am dreaming
People try 2 break us up
Valentines a little rough
But we survived ç¢¿os we had a love
Extraordinary
Iç£? give the world 2 U
Each and every thing U do is so very nice
U make my clock tick 12 twice
Then disappear time and everything else
When U R near
