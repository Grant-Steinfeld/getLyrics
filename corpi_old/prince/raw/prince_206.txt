title=Little Red Corvette

I guess I shoulda known
By the way u parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See you're the kinda person
That believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb
'Cuz U had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night
I guess that makes it all right
And U say what have I got 2 lose?
And honey I say
Little red corvette
Baby you're much 2 fast
Little red corvette
U need a love that's gonna last
I guess I shoulda closed my eyes
When U drove me 2 the place
Where your horses run free
'Cuz I felt a little ill
When I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not
I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class
But it was Saturday night
I guess that makes it all right
And U say, "Baby, have U got enough gas?"
Oh yeah
Little red corvette
Baby you're much 2 fast, yes U r
Little red corvette
U need 2 find a love that's gonna last
A body like yours (A body like yours)
Oughta be in jail (Oughta be in jail)
'Cuz it's on the verge of bein' obscene
('Cuz it's on the verge of bein' obscene)
Move over baby (Move over baby)
Gimme the keys (Gimme the keys)
I'm gonna try 2 tame your little red love machine
(I'm gonna try 2 tame your little red love machine)
Little red corvette
Baby you're much 2 fast
Little red corvette
U need 2 find a love that's gonna last
Little red corvette
Honey U got 2 slow down (Got 2 slow down)
Little red corvette
'Cuz if U don't u gonna run your
Little red corvette right in the ground
(Little red corvette)
Right down 2 the ground (Honey U got 2 slow down)
U, U, U got 2 slow down (Little red corvette)
You're movin' much 2 fast (2 fast)
U need 2 find a love that's gonna last
Girl, U got an ass like I never seen
And the ride...
I say the ride is so smooth
U must be a limousine
Baby you're much 2 fast
Little red corvette
U need a love, U need a love that's
That's gonna last
(Little red corvette)
U got 2 slow down (U got 2 slow down)
Little red corvette
'Cuz if U don't, 'cuz if U don't,
U gonna run your body right into the ground (Right into the ground)
Right into the ground (Right into the ground)
Right into the ground (Right into the ground)
Little red corvette
