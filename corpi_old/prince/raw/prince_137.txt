title=Goldie's Parade

U stick around
Goldnigga (What U hear at our concert is the real thing)
Be your own man
Endless abyss (What U hear at our concert is the real thing)
Do U love me?
Is this just a carnival ride?
We go round and round (What U hear at...)
As we go round and round
U stick around
We got a caller on the line, caller, caller on the..., hello
The land of a New Power Generation (Who said that?)
Playin' the music 4 your mind, your body and your soul
The land of a New Power Generation
U stick around, but remember I'm the boss
Can I get some help over here
Another 30 seconds
Have U ever heard a horn so nasty?
Goldnigga
Incubated society (Clean it up, boy)
What U gonna do with your life? (This is smooth)
U stick around
(What U hear at our concert is the real thing)
And ain't shit changed in 20 years, y'all
(What... what U hear at our concert is the real thing)
2 all my fellow Goldniggaz
U stick around
(What U hear at our concert is the real thing)
Instead of leading, we are being lead
But remember, I'm the boss
Caller, caller on the..., hello
Listen 2 the funky horn, y'all
Do U love me?
Goldnigga
Playin' the music 4 your mind, your body and your soul
And ain't shit changed in 20 years, y'all
The land of a New Power Generation
We go round and round
Do U love me?
Endless abyss
Incubated society
Is this just a carnival ride?
The land of a New Power Generation
Is this just a carnival ride?
Incubated society
The land of a New Power Generation
Is this just a carnival ride?
In..in..incubated society
Goldnigga
Be your own man
U stick around, but remember I'm the boss
And I give all the orders {laughter}
