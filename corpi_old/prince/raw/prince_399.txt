title=When U Love Somebody

I was the one sleepin' all alone
When U were at the party
I was the one waitin' by the phone
When U were with somebody
Now here U come again with your heart in your hands
Confessin' all of your sins, yeah
The same tired line that I've heard a dozen times
But still I've got 2 give in
CHORUS:
Cuz when U love somebody
Every now and then it might rain
When U love somebody
With every sun shower there's pain
Whenever something's lost, something's gained
When U love somebody
When U love someone
U were the one lookin' 4 some action
I was just lookin' 4 U
"Who needs love when U got protection"
Quote, unquote your point of view
All my partners say that I need 2 dismiss ya
Until they see U smile (Such a pretty smile)
All them fools are buggin' cuz they just want your lovin'
In the backseat, huh, 4 a little while (But I don't care)
CHORUS
(When U love somebody)
(Might rain)
Yeah, yea
Check me out on the floor
So what, U got me open
Yeah, do your dance
But I'm the one U're dancin' 4
And U know this
Round and round, don't stop it
And U know this, yeah, yeah
Up and down, U got it
Cuz when U love somebody (When U love somebody)
Every now and then it might rain (Now and then it might rain)
When U love somebody
With every sun shower there's pain
(Baby, a little pain, a little pain, yeah)
Whenever something's lost, something's gained
(Every now and then U got 2 think about what U gain) (Think U
don't?)
When U love somebody (Yeah) (When U love somebody)
Every now and then it might rain (Might rain)
When U love somebody (Pourin' down, down on me)
With every sun shower there's pain (Come on, wet me rain)
Whenever something's lost, something's gained (Something's
gained)
When U love somebody, yeah
When U love somebody {x7}
(So sweet)
(It's complete)
Well (So nice)
(It's paradise)
Round and round, don't stop it
Round and round, don't stop the pounds
Cuz a brutha gettin' down here lately
Freedom agrees with us all, U see
In a state of mind that's weightless
See, on the quantum tip I flipped on the notion
When the Adam split, we got Eve
Duality's now a groupie with a backstage pass
And they ain't gonna leave till they get some
From grace we fall
Referring 2 the objects on the wall
I'd picture my hat, my coat, my balls
Around and round (Round and round) {x2}
Huh, don't stop the pounds (Don't stop the pounds)
Yeah, cuz a brutha gettin' down here lately
Mm
