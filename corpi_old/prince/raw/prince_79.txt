title=Damned If I Do

Damned if I do
Tell me what's up with the teenage indecision
I'm mad in love but U won't give me permission
U said, "Be here at 9"
Then scream at me 4 not giving U more time, more time
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
U say U want me 2 love U
But when I try, U won't
Maybe, maybe we should say goodbye
Damned if I do
Tell me the truth, how many U do it 2?
I smell vermouth everytime I don't get 2 kiss U
Enough's enough
If U don't want my lovin', then I'll give up, I'll give up
CHORUS:
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
U say U want me 2 love U
But when I try, U won't
Baby, maybe we should say goodbye
Goodbye
Damned if I don't try 2 make U see yourself the way I do
Open minded, worldly, always ready 4 taboo
Tell me what's up, are we gonna go 2 heaven?
I'll fill your cup, I won't do it like Kevin
CHORUS
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
Baby, maybe we should say goodbye
Maybe we should say, "I do"
TÃº siempre estÃ¡s hablando de lo quÃ© tenemos quÃ© hacer
{U're always speaking about what we should do}
Bueno, tÃº sabes
{Well, U know}
Pero lo quÃ© tienes quÃ© hacer
{But what U should do}
QuÃ©? {What?}
Es buscarte una menta para la boca porque apestas!
{Is get a breath mint because your mouth stinks!}
QuÃ© es lo quÃ© tÃº estÃ¡s diciendo?
{What are U saying?}
Por favor... cometelas todas!
{Please... eat them all!}
A mi no me apesta la boca!
{My breath doesn't stink!}
