Hey yo, Kirk
U know, I'm thinkin' why don't we put this shit out ourselves
Hey girlfriend, how U doin'?
Listen, I got 2 tickets 2 the N.P.G. concert, wanna go?
Fuck the record company!
There's 2 many ways 4 them 2 stiff us
Besides, they'd have 2 be talkin crazy bank before we'd sign with 'em
Think about it
Yeah girl, all them brothers got money
It's at the Glam Slam
Yeah, pick U up at 8
Say what? Cut some live tracks?
Yeah, we could do that
Oh, by the way, can I borrow that red dress of yours
Studio live, the double-decker vibe
I'm in the proper mood 2night
Huh, yeah, I'm with it
Whatever U do, don't wear that nasty-ass Eternity or we're dead
So check it out, have the crew set up at the Slam 2night
And I'll get the truck
Alright girl, see U later
And matter of fact, see if Johnny can come down
Cuz we gonna rip it up 2night
It's go'n be so funky, boy, they go'n have 2 call the law
