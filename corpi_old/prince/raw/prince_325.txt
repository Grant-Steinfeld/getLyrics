Girl, oh girl {x2} (Girl)
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby {x2}
(Like he said, U're a sexy mutha) {repeated throughout song}
Could U be the most beautiful girl in the world? Ooh
(Could U be?)
It's plain 2 see U're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes U are
When the day turns into the last day of all time
I can say I hope that U are in these arms of mine, oh yes
And when the night falls before that day I will cry
I will cry tears of joy cuz after U all one can do is die, oh hey, yeah
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
Could U be the most beautiful girl in the world? Ooh
It's plain 2 see U're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes U are
How can I get through days when I can't get through hours?
I can try but when I do I see U and I'm devoured, oh yes I am
Who'd allow, who'd allow a face 2 be soft as a flower? Ooh
I could bow and feel proud in the light of this power
Ooh ya got it?
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
Could U be the most beautiful girl in the world?
Could U be?
It's plain 2 see U're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes U are
And when the stars fall one by one from the sky
I know Mars a-could not be 2 far behind
Cuz baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason 2 ever be shy
Cuz honey, this kind of beauty is the kind that comes from inside
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
Could U be the most beautiful girl in the world?
So beautiful, beautiful
It's plain 2 see U're the reason that God made a girl
Ooh baby {x2} (Ooh baby)
Could U be the most beautiful girl in the world?
Ow! I wanna know, I wanna know
It's plain 2 see U're the reason that God made a girl
U're the reason, oh yes U are
And if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky, oh yes
(Could U be the most beautiful girl in the world?)
I know Mars could not be 2 far behind
(It's plain 2 see U're the reason that God made a girl)
(Could U be the most beautiful girl in the world?)
So beautiful, beautiful
Could U be the most beautiful girl in the world?) {x2}
(Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby) {x2}
