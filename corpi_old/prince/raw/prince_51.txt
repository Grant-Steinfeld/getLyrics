Step, step 2 the mic, huh
Step 2 the mic and taste the hype
It's manifested, this blessed gift, I had 2 bring it right
So let me dive right in
Where do I begin? Hmm, well, let me...
Call the law (call the law), we're gettin' busy y'all (we're gettin' busy y'all)
Call the law (call the law), we're gettin' busy y'all (we're gettin' busy y'all)
Call the law (call the dogs), we're gettin' busy y'all (we're gettin' busy y'all)
Call the law (call the law), we're gettin' busy y'all (we're gettin' busy y'all)
(Ho, ho, ho, ho!) (Alright) {repeat}
(Ooh) The law, they come around when everyone's having a ball
And by the way, that reminds me of a party y'all
North side Minnie, Twin Cities, mid-summer on the scene
And my people get busy fryin' up the bird (Get the chicken, baby)
Word, whoever heard of a party bein' ready without a money makin' pot of spaghetti (Ha ha ha)
Yeah, what U laughin' at?
I'm sellin' liquor plus some plates at $7 a crack
Huh, and that's profitable
And 4 a sucker like U, that's a mouthful
Hmph, U better call the law cuz we gettin' extreme
Pick it up P
Call the law (call the law), we're gettin' busy y'all (we're gettin' busy y'all) {x4}
(Ho, ho, ho, ho!) (Alright) {repeat}
Alright

(Man, I don't know what the hell y'all sellin')
(Fellas, yo, what U doin' now?) (What U doin' Tone?)
Boy, I ain't turning down nothing, this is my place
U know what I'm sayin'?
Homeboy
Back 2 the scene, the basement's packed
Buddy at the front door breakin' backs
That's security ensuring thee
The best possible time 4 U and me, yeah
The party's jumpin' (Ho, ho, ho)
Everybody's bumpin' 2 Rock Creek Park when (Ho, ho, ho)
Bo and his girl got silly (What'd she do?)
Jumped up on my chandelier and got busy, yeah
He had 2 snatch the ho (What?)
We got Geo in the background screamin', "Here we go, here we go!"
Yeah, the tempo's upbeat
Hollywood swingin' at the end of the bar
He began singin', "If I didn't care..."
Yeah, U better call the law (call the law)
We're gettin' busy y'all (we're gettin' busy y'all)
(Ho, ho, ho, ho, here we go, here we go!) (Alright) {repeat}
Yeah, that's alright
Give it 2 me, come on
Yeah, mm hmm, alright
Mmm hmm, yeah
Kick it P (U better call the law)

Peace
Alright, alright
