"OBJECTS IN THE MIRROR"
This is my favorite time with u
just after we make a movie,
the kind requires the title
"Parental Advisory"
Let's brush r theeth in the same sink
don't worry girl it's cool
We can pose the mirror,
I'm digging u digging on me
yea, me digging on u
We're hooked up now, i can try her
I can put my load in the dryer
So we can share
the same heught, weight, and body fluid
We hooked up now, we can do it
Been waitin baby...
It's so hard 2 bear
the objects in the mirrorr r closer
than they appear..."
