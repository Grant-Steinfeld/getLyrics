title=Gett Off (Extended Remix)

Club Mix {x2}
Gett off {repeat in Background}
How can I put this in a way so as not 2 offend or unnerve?
But there's a rumor goin' all around that U ain't been gettin' served
They say that U ain't "U know what" in, baby, who knows how long
It's hard 4 me 2 say what's right when all I wanna do is wrong
CHORUS:
Gett off - 23 positions in a one night stand
Gett off - I'll only call U after if U say I can
Gett off - Let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
Gett off - If U want 2, baby, here I am
(Here I am)
I clocked the jizz from a friend of yours named Vanessa Bet (Bet)
She said U told her a fantasy that got her all wet (Wet)
Something about a little box with a mirror and a tongue inside (Yeah)
What she told me then got me so hot, I knew that we could slide (Ooh)
CHORUS
(Come on)
Gett off {x2}
1 2 3
Naw, little cutie, I ain't drinkin'
But scope this, I was just thinkin'
U + me, what a ride
If U was thinkin' the same, we could continue outside
Lay your pretty body against the parkin' meter
Strip your dress down like I was strippin' a Peter Paul's Almond Joy
Lemme show U, baby, I'm a talented boy
(Oh yeah)
Club mix
Everybody grab a body
Pump it like U want somebody
Gett off
Everything about U just screams of a real sexy affair (Ooh yeah)
The nasty way U walk, the way U flip your hair (U know it, poppa)
Babygirl, I'm all veins when I'm scopin' that body rare (Oh, stop it)
Betcha I'ma pack a lunch and spend a while there, ohh
CHORUS
(Can we?)
I'm gonna kiss in U front of everybody, I don't care
That's right, I pulled your dress up
Shit, U ain't got no underwear on
I shoulda known, I shoulda known
Butterscotch curly hair, I wish U had some drawers on now
Stone freak 2 the bone
I can't believe it, we're going home
Everybody grab a body, pump it like U want somebody {x2}
So here we, so here we
So here we are, here we are in my paisley crib
What cha want 2 eat? (Ribs!)
Naw Toy, I don't serve ribs
U better be happy that dress is still on
I heard the rip when U sat down
Honey, them hips is gone
But that's alright, I clock 'em that way
Remind me of somethin' James used 2 say
"I like 'em fat, I like 'em proud
U got 2 have a mother 4 me"
Now move your big ass 'round this way
So I can work on that zipper, baby
2night U're a star and I'm the Big Dipper
Na, na, na, na {x2}
Everybody grab a body, pump it like U want somebody (Gett off) {x2}
Ooh, I think I like it with the dress half on
I'll zip it far enough 2 see the crack'o'dawn
Don't worry about the bust, I'm gonna lock up every door
Then we can do it in the kitchen on the floor
Or in the bathroom standing on the tub and holding on the rod
U're in the closet underneath the clothes and...oh my God!
In the bedroom on the dresser with your feet on the drawers
In the pantry on the shelf, I guaranteed U won't be bored
The pool table, yeah, move the sticks
And put the 8-ball where it's sure 2 stick
Dudley do no wrong 2night if Nell just let him kick it
(Kick it) {x3}
How can I put this in a way so as not 2 offend or unnerve?
But there's a rumor goin' all around that U ain't been gettin' served
They say that U ain't "U know what" in, baby, who knows how long
It's hard 4 me 2 say what's right when all I wanna do is wrong
CHORUS
(Come on)
(Gett off) {repeat till end}
