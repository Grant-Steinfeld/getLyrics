title=The Screams Of Passion

Performed by The Family
{From The Family (1985)}
Woah, no. Woah, yeah.
Woah, no, woah no, yeah, yeah
There's a gentle autumn breeze
That blows whenever we be lyin'
Lyin' in my bed
The moon appears and disappears
U look at me, my clothes I quickly
I quickly shed
The curtains dance a minuet
Autumn plays the music baby
Come on hold my hand
Leaves are fallin' velvet splash
Only u and I can under
Only u can understand
The sunlight draws a picture
Through the silky lace that hangs above your
Hangs above your door
A picture that is waving
That is seems to be with every thrust
U make me beg for more
A robin sings a masterpiece
That lives and dies unheard
For screams of passion
A sound produced by two in love (oh, two in love)
Curtains dance and autumn plays on (and on and on)
The screams of passion
All I hear in my [head/hair]
Echoing like a volcano baby
The screams of passion
Back and forth the raging seas of lust
I want u madly
Can't u tell, can't u tell
Can't u tell, can't u tell, Ow!
Take me in your arms, oh baby
The crime is done
I'd rather die here in your
Screams of passion (Woah, hold me now, baby)
Tell me that u [want/love] me (tell me that u [want/love] me)
Is it Sunday or is it passion?
The screams of passion (the screams of passion, yeah)
The screams of... the screams of...
The screams of passion (passion)
Yeah! (shhh, not so loud, baby)
Yeah! (shhh, shhh)
The screams of passion
The screams of passion
The screams of passion
The screams of... the screams of...
The screams of passion
The screams of passion
Back and forth the raging seas of lust
Raging, raging (the screams of passion)
U know I want u madly, baby
Why can't u tell?
Is it Sunday?
I thought I heard a churchbell (or was it passion?)
Passion (Yeah, yeah)
Passion
The screams of passion
What'd u say baby?
Excuse me but is that your passion?
Do u want my passion?
Do u want my passion?
If u want my love
If u want my body baby
Let me hear u... let me hear u... let...
Let me hear u scream
I want some passion
U know what I'm talkin about baby?
I want some passion
U got that baby?
I want some passion
Passion
