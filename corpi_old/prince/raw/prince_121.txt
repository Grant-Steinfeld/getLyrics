title=Freaks On This Side

Freaks on this side, the freaks on this side {x8}
When U can't find the reason 4 the smoke
There's probably water in the fire
When everything U know ain't enough 2 float your boat
And U're lookin' 4 somethin' that'll take U higher
CHORUS:
U got 2 get down (Freaks on this side, the freaks on this side)
2 a brand new sound (Freaks on this side, the freaks on this side)
In the water U'll drown (Freaks on this side, the freaks on this
side)
But the lost is found (Freaks on this side, the freaks on this side)
Come on, baby
When confusion tries 2 tear your world apart
And the demons fight 4 power
That's the time U got 2 listen 2 your heart
No one knows the final hour
CHORUS
When U see an illusion everywhere U look
When U know the process of creation
When U understand everything in every book
Congratulations - U're in the New Power Generation!
(Freaks on this side, the freaks on this side) {x4}
The freaks on this side! {x3}
When everybody calls the truth by a different name
And the indifference between us still remains
God is Love, Love is God - simple and plain
Party in this way, there's so much more 2 gain
(Freaks on this side, the freaks on this side) {repeat 2 end}
(Get on down, down, down, down, down)
Freaks on this side
We drownin' (Get on down, down, down, down, down)
Yeah, yeah
U got 2 get down
(U got 2 get down) {x2}
It's New Power Generation
And U're groovin' 2 another jam of the year
Think it ain't when it is
And we be drownin'
Glug, glug like a mug
Looka here - freak on this side
The freaks on this side
Looka here - on this side
On this side
The freaks on... U got it on this side
