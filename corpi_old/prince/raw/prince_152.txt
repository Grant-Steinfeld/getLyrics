Ahhh yes
it's a horny pony,baby
Ahhh yes
There ya go, there ya go
Horny ponies gather here {x2}
Horny ponies gather here
We are fixin' 2 put it in all your ears
We got a new style 4 the next 8 years
I'm talkin' about the dance that every horse fears the most
It's a sex position - it's a new dance
And it's rockin' from coast 2 coast
I'm talkin' about, I'm talkin' about?
I'm talkin' about the Horny Pony, y'all - come on
There ya go, there ya go
Horny Pony
Girlfriend, look at this pony Prince is doin' now
Is he weird or what?
Sing (Horny Pony)
Now that's 2 freaky!
In the years of the war, we don't wanna know
U're fuckin' that pony like U really go 4 the hip stuff
A into the S into the S
It ain't enough just 2 do some exstacy
U want it in your hip, U want it in your thighs
It's the style that conservatives most despise
Cuz it's the horny pony - it's the new position
And it's rockin' every horny ponette, every pony
It's the Horny Pony, y'all (Horny Pony)
And there ya go
Turn around
Chicken grease in the house
Chicken grease? I don't know
That's it, I gotta run
And U can run all the way 2 Barcelona
But U can't hide, the Horny Pony get U gonna
Don't look at me y'all, I just wrote it
Put on a record, wrapped it up and then I sold it
Horny people gather here {x2} (How long?)
4 the next 8 years
We got a new dance - it's the Horny Pony
Yeah, the music's jammin', but it's about these words
Sing (Horny Pony)my dickkkkkkkkkkkkkkGirl, uh-uh - nope!
