title=When I Lay My Hands On You

The message you're about to hear is not meant for transmission
Should only be accessed in the privacy of your mind
The words are intense so my dear if you dare to listen
Take off your clothes
Meet me between the lines
Are you ready for the touch that makes you go insane
Breast to lips to cheek to mane
I pull your hair, you will feel no pain
Are you ready for the only forever we'll both obtain
The only joy in this forsaken game
Feel ashamed and ordained
When I lay my hands on you
The touch you're about to feel is the one you've been wishin' for
It's been here like an echo inside your space and time
It's about to get freaky cause the places that I'll be kissin'
Are the places that no other man could ever find
Are you ready for the touch that makes you go insane
Breast to lips to cheek to mane
I pull your hair, you will feel no pain
Are you ready for the only forever we'll both obtain
The only joy in this forsaken game (God forbid)
Feel ashamed and ordained (God forbid)
When I lay my hands on you
Nobody knows
Like I know
Where the deepest part of your river flows
Snap Snap
Undo these nylon hose
Around your thigh my finger goes slowly
Like a cat tip-toes
Until I reach the capstone
I will touch thee in the softest manner
Like Europa in the hands of Santana
Are you ready for the touch that makes you go insane
Breast to lips to cheek to mane
I pull your hair, you will feel no pain
Are you ready for the only forever we'll both obtain
The only joy in this forsaken game
Feel ashamed and ordained
When I lay my hands on you
When I lay my hands on you
