title=Most Beautiful Girl In The World

Could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world
Uh
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
Ooh
When the day
Turns into the last day of all time
I can say
I hope you are in these arms of mine
And when the night
Falls before that day I will cry, I'll cry
Tears of joy
'Cause after you all one can do is die
Oh...ho...ho...oh...oh...
Could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world
Could you be
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes, you are
How can I
Get through days when I can't get through hours, mmm
I can try
But when I do I see you and I'm devoured, oh, yes
Who'd allow, who'd allow
A face to be soft as a flower
I could bow [Bow down]
And feel proud in the light of this power
Oh...ho...yes...oh...ho...
Could you be, could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world
Could you be
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes, you are
And if the stars
Ever fell one by one from the sky
I know Mars
Could not be, uh, too far behind
'Cause baby, this kind of beauty
Has got no reason to ever be shy
'Cause honey, this kind of beauty
Is the kind that comes from inside
Could you be, could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world
So beautiful, beautiful
It's plain to see, plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
Ho...ho...ho...yeah...
Could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world
You, you must be a, oh....yeah
It's plain to see, ooh...ooh...
You're the reason that God made a girl
You're the reason, hey, hoo, yeah
If the stars ever fell one by one from the sky
Oh...ho...ho...ooh...yeah
I know Mars could not be to far behind
Oh...ooh...ho...
Could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world
Could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world
