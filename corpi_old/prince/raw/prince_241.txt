2 the darkness - let there be light
2 the soundman - turn up my voice real tight
2 the N.P.G. - if U in this mother, scream
Show me how U all get down - 1 2 3, come on
Get freaky, let the head bob {x2}
We should all come 2gether 2 the Newpower Soul
Get freaky, let the head bob {x2} (Come on, come on)
It'll make U feel much better - come on, baby, let's go!
Every while in a great once there comes 2 town a show
That lives up 2 all your funkspectation no matter how high or low
A reason 2 get your freak on in a way U never freaked before
Newpower Soul lay claim 2 the booty - come on, let's go
(Lemme see U get down)
Let the head bob
Get freaky, let the head bob (Come on, come on)

It'll make U feel much better - come on, baby, let's go!
Every while in a day twice funky matters in our ear
As long as we keep our love strong, we'll never shed no tears
The brothas be threatenin' 2 jump off buildings, Newpower's what
they fear
Love 4 one another risin', Newpower Soul is here
(Lemme see U get down)
