title=Cybersingle

Chorus:
I am the cybersingle, that is me
Come and get my download
To be free or not to be free,
That is the question, see?
All the beautiful ones are with me
See, its lovely
As the media tightens
(what?)
its grip on you
(you know)
And the beast continues
(what?)
to split in two
(listen y'all)
Superman steps in the phone booth
(word)
one more time
(come on, come on)
To drop another cybersingle
(drop it)
life-saving rhyme
(it's lovely)
Lookin' for a sound  that'll make you organize
Dead Prez. are Rage conspire to open up your eyes
(Can you see?)
What good is a mind of a man if its run by another
(nothing)
Take back your conscience, my sisters and brothers!
Chorus:
(yeah, yeah)
(That is me)
(download)
(Free)
It's lovely
Can't leave the keys in my brand-new car
Cuz you don't know it's wrong to steal
The devil got you thinkin' he's invisible
But how he makes you act is real
Stupid
Talk a beat
Turn around, long hand, come on
Cybersingle
Television got your mind but you got to get free
Cybersingle
Open your eyes
Purple Haze
(awhoo)
Jesus saves
Cybersingle
(awhoo)
Sister and brothers! Have Love 4 One Another!
Sister and brothers! Have Love 4 One Another!
Cyber, cyber {x2}
