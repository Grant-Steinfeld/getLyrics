title=Nothing Compares To You

It's been seven hours and thirteen days
Since u took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since u took your love away
Since u been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues,
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 u
It's been so lonely without u here
I'm like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop this lonely tears from fallin'
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
I can put my arms around every girl I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said boy u'd better try to have fun
No matter what u do
But he's a fool
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 u
All the flowers that u planted mama
In the back-yard
All died when u went away
I know that living with me baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 u
