title=Power Fantastic

Late at night, when the world is sleeping
U r frightened, 'cause the Power's creeping
In your room is something u're afraid of
Life or doom is what this feeling's made of
Power Fantastic
Is in your life at last
U're a little apprehensive
'Cause what it is is what u want and need
Minor G is the chord of pleasure
It will be played eleven measures
U will see fire, but u're cool as ice
U lie if u say this isn't nice.
Power Fantastic
Is in your life at last
U're a little apprehensive
What it is is what u want and need
Power, Power
Power Fantastic
Is in your life at last
U're a wee bit apprehensive
'Cause what it is is what u want and need
Power, Power, Power Fantastic
