(In sports, the International Basketball League was busy last night)
(With 7 games on the schedule)
{phone rings}

(Beating the Bullets 108 to 99)
Talk

Watch what?
I don't know what it is, it's crazy
(The Nuggets just got by the Nets 114 to 112)
What channel is it on?

Later
(The Super Sonics devastated the Jazz 136...)
So I'm walkin' down the street and umm..
This muthafucka comes up 2 me and says
(Yo man, U oughta let me have 50 dollars man)
(Can U give?)
I said "Ain't that a bitch? U oughta get out of my face"
(Oh)
And he tried 2 rob me
(Muthafucker, mm)
And he was chokin' me, right?
Cuz, cuz he didn't have no gun
Do U hear that shit?
Lucky 4 me, my homies was comin' 'round the 7-Eleven
And they seen what was goin' down
They grabbed this muthafucker, right?
("What's up man?")
Ripped an eyeball out
(Ahhh! "Fuck him up")
They beat his ass so bad, change fell out his pocket
(U bastards, mm)
These nigga's are crazies
So I said "Fuck it"
I robbed him, ha ha
With so much money on me, I figured I oughta hit Jannell's house
I knocked on her door, right?
(Mmm, oh)
I don't know what she was doin'
(Oh, ooh)
But I couldn't get no answer?
She was doin' some wrong shit
"Jannell" I shouted, still no answer
(Mmm, oh, oh)
I figured she was on the telephone or somethin'
(Oh)
So I walked around 2 the bathroom window
Pushed it up, climbed inside
Soon as I got inside, it hit me {gasp}
Damn!
I don't know what it was but it hit me hard
"Uh"
Jannell's a Rican, U know?
And them beans and rice is a habit at Jannell's house, U know?
I grab my mouth, my nose and I just screamed
And then I ran
But Jannell's house is real messy and I hit somethin' and I fell
That somethin' was Jannell
(Get off!)
I stepped on her bruised booty she got from stage diving
And it made her real mad so we went 2 rounds
Jannell can bob
She kicked my ass
Damn!
"Oh God"
So I left and I went 2 Glam Slam
And slammed a few Long Island's
Uh-oh, one 2 many
Excuse me brother, better hit this alley
Phew! That was close
(Yo muthafucker, ain't U the one stole my money?)
Oh shit
