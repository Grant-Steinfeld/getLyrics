title=18 & Over

18 & over
(Come) {repeat in song}
CHORUS:
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya (Yeah, baby)
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good)
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya (Yeah, baby)
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good)
Now wait a minute
This ain't nothin' but a little funky mack song
All I'm sayin' is that I wanna smack it all night long
On and on until the early morn'
Givin' up all U need so U can get your groove on
And as long as I got your attention (Yeah)
There's a couple of new positions that I'd like 2 mention
Did U ever hear the one about the pinwheel? (No)
That's the one where I put your legs behind your head
And real dirty like, I'ma spin U around
And grab U by the waist and pump U till I hear my baby say "Oww!"
That's what I know U like
I'm your nigga now and I'm about 2 read your rights
And as sure as I'm a nasty boy (What?)
My girl, U know U got the right 2 make plenty noise (Oh!)
Cuz this is your night and I'ma do U real good
Just like a Kemo Sabe, Bone Ranger should
Come
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good)
Come
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good)
And er ah...
That's what we layin' 4 in the 9 5
As long we know it's safe, we ain't riskin' no lives (Yeah)
My doctor's name is Feelgood, makin' it so I do
And if your name is "Healthy" then it's cool if me and U
Just come - yeah baby, U should do all that
Come - yeah baby
(Oh yeah, this is gonna be good)
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya
18 & over
Hi-yo Silver, it's the Bone Ranger, I'll freak U 2 the marrow
With a little somethin' that I call the wheelbarrow
Walkin' up on your hands while I straddle your thighs
In goes the truth and out goes the lie
And before the beach gets 2 sandy (Uh oh)
We'll call a wet towel, W.C. - it's Handy
And it's all nice, comin' one, comin' twice
And if the Johnny's slippery, we'll have 2 take the trip 2 Electricity
And check out the sights (Check out the sights)
And check out the sights
When I blow that mind, baby (All night, alright)
I'm gonna drive U crazy (All night, alright)
(Oh yeah, this is gonna be good)
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya
18 & over
Electricity (Electricity)
Plug it in if U dare, plug it in if U dare
This motherfucker's so fast, it eats underwear
So there, my little sweet sugar bear
If that ain't enough 2 make U throw your hands in the air
Then I'm all gone like the horns in this song (Oh oh oh oh!)
Cuz I gots 2 keep U comin' till the early morn'
And if U like that, then U can come back
And if U don't - smack! And I'm out
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya
When I blow that mind, baby (All night, alright)
I'm gonna drive U crazy (All night, alright)
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good)
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good)
CHORUS
(Oh yeah, this is gonna be good)
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) {x2}
