Oh, your car got mags that be dippy dippy dope
But the whole damn nation got the same
Honey only flock 2 the bee that's the Pope
Not the President with government lame
Put me on a slow movin' parlimentary hackin' bandwagon
U could put me little ass in the grave
Everytime u want it I'll be live, bring a date
I mean computer when its over press save
So u can be the President (U can be the President) [Kick it]
I'd rather be the Pope (Rather be the Pope)
(I'd rather be... so happy)
Yeah u can be the side effect (U can be the side effect)
I'd rather be the dope (Rather be the dope)
(I ain't scared of u mutha fuckers) [Kick it]
Call your girl named Sally and u figure u were chill (Chill)
Then u find out I'm the reason Sally's on the Pill (Pill)
What am I supposed to do when the President can't get nothing passed
Find an alley, find an alley
Undress Sally right in front of your ass
(Well she helped me once again)
I say u can be the President (U can be the President) [Kick it]
I'd rather be the Pope (Rather be the Pope)
(I'd rather be... so help me)
Yeah u can be the side effect (U can be the side effect)
I'd rather be the dope (Rather be the dope)
(Fuck that)
The Pope
(Oh no motherfucker, not today)
Pope
U can be the President (Rather be the Pope)
So help me
Who's the funky drummer with the crooked little sticks (Sticks)
He might have better luck if he was drummin' with his dick (Dick?)
If u don't play the piccolo, why u wanna lick?
(Ch-check) Now check the drum solo and tell me not to kick it
(Seek and destroy. It'll fuck u up)
I love the taste of unpredictable licks
A loop is a loop is a loop
A loop is a loop is a loop [Fuck that]
A loop is a loop is a loop is a loop is a loop is a loop is a loop
Your car got mags that be dippy dippy dope
But the whole damn nation got the same
Honey only flock 2 the bee that's the Pope
Not the President with government lame
Put me on a slow movin' parlimentary hackin' bandwagon
U could put me little ass in the grave
Everytime u want it I'll be live, bring a date
I mean computer when its over press save
(So) So u can be the president (U can be the President) [Kick it]
I'd rather be the pope (Rather be the Pope)
(I wanna be... so happy)
U can be the side effect (U can be the side effect)
I'd rather be the dope (U, u, u) [U can be the dope]
The Pope
U can be the President (Fuck that)
Rather be the Pope
Baby, so help me please
Press Save

Peace
