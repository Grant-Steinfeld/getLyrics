title=A Woman's Gotta Have It

Performed by Nona Gaye
Composed by B. Womack, L. Womack and D. Carter
Oh oh oh (A woman's gotta have it)
(A woman's gotta have it)
Do the things that keep a smile on her face
Say the words that make her feel better every day
U betcha better keep on your P's and Q's
If U don't, your woman U could easily lose
Oh, I had love, a true love and I lost it
And no one seems 2 understand about the pain that it cost me
A woman's gotta have it, I believe
She's got 2 know that she's needed around
When U kiss her, U got 2 make her feel it
She wants 2 know that she's not walking on shaky ground
When U miss her, U got 2 be 4-realin'
Make her know that she's needed around
Don't take 4 granted the smile upon her face
Check a little bit closer, U might find a tear trace
Maybe the little girl never said a mufflin' word
But she's got 2 know that her voice is heard
Oh, I had love, a true love and I lost it
And no one seems 2 understand about the pain that it cost me
A woman's gotta have it, I believe that I should know
She's got 2 know that she's needed around
When U kiss her, U got 2 make her feel it
She wants 2 know that she's not walking on shaky ground
When U miss her, U got 2 be 4-realin'
Make her know that she's needed around
Oh, I had love, a true love and I lost it
Now I'm sufferin' all this pain that the true love cost me
A woman's gotta have it, I believe that I should know
She's got 2 know that she's needed around
When U kiss her, U got 2 make her feel it
She wants 2 know that she's not walking on shaky ground
When U miss her, U got 2 be 4-realin'
Make her know that she's needed around
A woman's gotta have it (A woman's gotta have it) {repeat to fade}
