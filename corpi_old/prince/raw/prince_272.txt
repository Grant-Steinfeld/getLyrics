title=Push It Up

(Push it up! Push it up!)
Put your hands up  come on (Push it up!)
Huh  yeah, this is it, this is it (Push it up!)
This is it
I think they got 2 get ready 4 this one here  come on!
(Ooh, everybody's here) Say what?
(This is the jam of the year)
Huh, what did I hear? (Push it up! Push it up!)
Uh, wasn't quite clear
(Ooh, everybody's here) Say what?
(This is the jam of the year)
Oh, huh - I hear ya, huh (Push it up! Push it up!)
Come on, uh
If U're ever down draggin' on the ground
Face twisted with a funky frown
Let me turn U on 2 somethin' that I found
2 make U feel good, feel good
Negativity like gravity
Gotcha fallin' fast from reality
U gotta get up, put up, move up
And just do what U should, U should
Realize that U are somebody
Come on, y'all, and join the party
Everybody grab a body
And feel good, U should...
CHORUS:
Push it up - push it up - push it up - push it up
(Ooh, everybody's here - this is the jam of the year)
(Push it up! Push it up!)
Push it up - push it up - push it up - push it up
(Ooh, everybody's here - this is the jam of the year)
(Push it up! Push it up!)
Push it up, push it up 2 the sky
U don't have 2 have a plane 2 fly
If U listen 2 the truth and not the lie
Stop cryin', cryin'
In harmony, can't U see
Every color all in the same key
And that's the way Jah wants us 2 be
Start tryin', a-tryin'
Realize that U are somebody
Come on, y'all, and join the party
Everybody grab a body
And feel good, U should...
CHORUS
Come on - wake up your body, wake up your body
Wake up your body and move it around  come on
Yeah, huh
Where the party at in here, y'all?
Where the party goin' down in here? Uh
Now I wanna know who's ready 2 show me
Get on down with the one and only party ambassador
Flip styles like a spatula mac-tacula
More Legend than a new Acura
Body tone stone while I rap 2 her
Capture her thinkin' I'm a mac 2 her
Just because I'm attracted 2 her
But the fact of the matter is the dance floor's phatter
The crowd's on fire as we push it up higher
Push it up! - come on, y'all
Push it up! - put your hands in the air
Push it up! - come on, y'all
Push it up! - while The Artist turn it up, come - uh!
Yeah, huh
Break it on down (Push it, push it up!)
Huh
This is the jam, this is the jam, this is the jam of the year {x2}
Push it up {x12}
Everybody grab a body, everybody push it up {x2}
On and on till the early morn' - push it up
Push it up {x7}
