title=Yo Mister

Yo Mister how's your daughter
You really ought to know
For every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone
My crazy friend named Cara
After all of us told her, ?No?
She givin? up speed ball
Now she's going nowhere stoned
Her papa caught her on the first time
And put her out on the street
Cara told me to remind him
That she was only 17
Yo Mister how's your daughter (How's your daughter)
You really ought to know
Every thing you taught her
It don't matter when she's all alone
Cara got hooked up with the wrong kids
Then she started skipping school
Then Cara got high top make disappear
A world full of fools
In her eyes her father was the biggest fool of ?em all
And she was speeding, that's what she'd say
Maybe, maybe, maybe she wouldn't talk so stupid
If she knew whatever she needed is far too gone
Yo Mister how's your daughter
You really ought to know
For every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone
She needs you right now Mister
'Cause she ain't got long to live
It's so easy to say, ?I love him?
But it's hard to forget
Her father cried when I told him
That Cara twice got knocked up
He said, ?Just like her mama, uh-huh
She shows her body when she wants to show love
She tried that stuff with me and I beat her down?
There's no way I could let her stay
Couldn't let her stick around
'Cause I tried so hard to raise her right
He said, ?What made her turn out this way?
I don't know
What made her turn out this way
I don't know, I don't know
And I said and I said and I said
Yo Mister how's your daughter
You really ought to know (Every thing)
Every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone
She needs you right now Mister
She ain't got long to live
It's so easy to say, ?I love him?
But it's hard to forget
Yo Mister how's your daughter (How's your daughter tonight)
Yo Mister how's your daughter (How's your daughter tonight)
Yo Mister how's your daughter (How's your daughter tonight)
Yo Mister how's your daughter (How's your daughter tonight)
