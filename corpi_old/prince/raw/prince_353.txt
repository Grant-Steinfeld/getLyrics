Listen, everybody wanna tell me how 2 play the game
When I run it better than a Madame runs dames
Tryin' 2 beat me is like playing pool with a rope
My funk will leave ya dead cuz it's good and plenty dope
All in all, I'm still the king and all y'all's the court

It's jacked, cuz I'm back, and I'm harder than a heart attack
Said I'm the cure for any disease cuz ain't nobody funky like me!
(Go Morris) {repeated}
