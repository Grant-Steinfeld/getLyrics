title=Loveleft, Loveright

The Girls of Steel
Like the way my body feels
They don't need 2 put their hands on
But, ooh, it gets 'em gone
Thinkin' 'bout the way things might have been
In another life if U were my wife
And I don't mean one, but the 2 o' U every night (Ooh)
Lord knows I'd do my best
I mean it'd be a test
Baby in the middle, baby in the middle taking all requests
CHORUS:
Love 2 the left of me, love 2 the right
Come on, make a noise somebody - party 2night (Oh yeah!)
Love 2 the left of me, love 2 the right
Come on, make a noise somebody - party 2night (Oh yeah!)
The Girls of Soul
Like the way my booty goes
They say the curves deserve another glance (Curves deserve)
Come on, pretty baby, give me a chance
2 prove my brotherhood
I'll make it real good
I'll do ya, I'll do ya, I'll do ya like U wanna should
Lord knows I'd do my best
I mean it'd be a test
Baby in the middle, baby in the middle taking all requests
CHORUS
I can't help it, baby
It really gets me gone (Love, love)
2 think about the 3 of us g-goin' on
The notion of the ocean
(Love) {x6}
Love 2 the left of me, love 2 the right
Come on, make a noise somebody - party 2night (Oh yeah!)
Love
Lord knows I'd do my best (Love)
I mean it'd be a test
Baby in the middle, baby in the middle taking all requests
CHORUS
I can't help it, baby (Love 2 the left of me)
It really gets me gone
2 think about the 3 of us g-goin' on (Love 2 the left of me)
The notion of the ocean sailing under me
(Love 2 the left of me, love 2 the right)
It's enough 2 make a man want 2 marry
And I don't mean one, but the 2 of U's ? naturally
(Love 2 the left of me, love 2 the right)
Come on make a noise, pretty baby - let's party 2night, alright
Party 2night (Oh yeah!) {x6}
Party 2night, party 2night
Party 2night (Oh yeah!) {x3}
Are there really angels or are they just in our mind?
It all comes out in the wash in time
