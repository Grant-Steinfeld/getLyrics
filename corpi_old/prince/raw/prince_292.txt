So my name is Endorphin
I can make U happy, U see
I come from Planet Venus and I'll take U there
U can be my ecstasy
The 80's are over and the time has come
4 a new proclamation of love and fun
Monogamy and trust is what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'll give up all my lovers if U can make me shout
Oh, S is 4 scandalous
E is 4 exciting
X is 4 adults-only
Let's do something frightening
Sex, sex
Can't stop the feelin' baby, nobody should
Sex, sex
Anything this dangerous has 2 be good
Now I'm the type of alien
Who knows just what he wants
But U're the type who plays in the trees
U got it maybe that's why U flaunt
Oh, I'll climb a thousand trees if I have 2
But baby I'm warning U
One of us is gonna end up on our knees
Sex, sex
Just can't stop the feeling baby, nobody should
Sex, sex
Anything this dangerous has 2 be good, good, good
Just has 2 be
Sex, sex

Let me dance under your skirt
(Get up) (Everybody on the dance floor now)
C'mon now

Let me show U how 2 flirt
(Get up) (Ooh feels good, ooh feels good)
Ahh, ooh

I like it girl, I knew U weren't wearin' any underwear (Get up)
Baby, is it wrong that I want U so?
I want U baby

S. E. X.
Sex, sex
Can't stop the feeling baby, nobody should
Sex, sex
Anything this dangerous has 2 be good, good, good
Just has 2 be good
Fellas, all the boys that know about the good thing say, "Yeah yeah!"
And all the girls with no underwear on say, "Yes!" (Yes)
We gettin' funky 2night
Sex
Yo! Peep this out

One lover - sex

So my name is Endorphin
